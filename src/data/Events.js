Through dance, we believe everyone can discover, explore, unleash, and enhance their individual potential to live a fulfilling and meaningful life. By engaging our senses and listening to our bodies, we connect to others and shape a consciousness that extends beyond our own.\n\n\n\n\n\n~ Some Loving Guidelines ~\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to create the ideal container, let's:\n\n\n~ Allow ourselves freedom from cell phones\n\n\n~ Let go of judgments of self and others – your dance is your unique expression\n\n\n~ Connect with our bodies while respecting our “yes” and honoring our “no”\n\n\n~ Be mindful to the boundaries of others and the space that we share\n\n\n~ Let our dance be our voice, instead of words, during the ecstatic dance\n\n\n~ Give our feet back their soul by removing our shoes in the movement space\n\n\n~ Respect the privacy of the container so that our truest expression can be unlocked\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease -\n\n\n~ No shoes, cell phones, or photography in the movement space\n\n\n~ Reserve conversations for the community spaces during the ecstatic dance\n\n\n~ Practice consent - let’s do our best to make this is a safer space\n\n\n~ Be clear-minded - this is a substance/alcohol-free event :)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe event is for ages 18+ (except for special dates)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur goal is to create loving and inclusive events. This will be a safer space for people of all colors, ethnicities, genders, and sexual orientations. Please practice proper consent and be mindful of the friends around you. Guardians of the Vibe will be on location to support if needed. ✨\n\n\n\n\n\nInSpirit is generally a camera-free event. We wanted to give you a heads up that tonight, the amazing photographer Melissa Robin Photography will be taking a few shots. During the dance - she will only take photos from 10-11pm (the higher energy time).\n\n\n\n\n\n~ Admission ~\n\n\nGet your tickets at returntospirit.eventbrite.com\n\n\n$25/$35 (pay what you can) online\n\n\n$17 Low Income Offering (Limited amount)\n\n\n$27-40 (sliding scale) at the door (the event may sell out before doors)\n\n\n\n\n\nWe kindly ask that our guests get their ticket online so we can be better prepared with quantities of cacao, tea, kava etc. It will also allow you quicker access to the event. \n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for selecting a ticket price that reflects where you are at financially. It is important to us that everyone in our community feels as though they have the opportunity to participate.

        "On Sunday, November 10th, the Buffalo Soldiers National Museum will honor military musicians that have inspired millions across the world with their service and tremendous talent for Veterans Day. World-renowned musician, Lieutenant James Reese Europe introduced jazz music to the French during WW1 and will be recognized for his musical contributions in the 1910s. The celebration will take place at the museum from 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM, and admission is free.\nThe Veterans Day program features a presentation by composer Dr. Anthony Branker, along with food and fellowship among guests. In addition to introducing Jazz to the French, Lt Europe and his regimental band boosted morale and provided outstanding entertainment for U.S. troops. This Veterans Day program recognizes the contributions and sacrifices made by the members of the Harlem Hell Fighters, says Captain Paul J. Matthews, Founder of the Buffalo Soldiers Museum. \nJames Reese Europe is cited in books about ragtime and early jazz as the most respected black bandleader of the 'teens' for the authenticity of his music which was rich in syncopation and jazz effects. Lt. Europe and his bandmates experienced the horrors of WW1 and were among the first African-American soldiers to enter a disarmed Germany. However, Jim’s remarkable talent allowed him fresh opportunities for playing his music to wide audiences after returning from the war. The Pathe record company secured his services as an exclusive artist and heavily promoted Europe's music. Recordings like, \"On Patrol In No Man's Land\" and \"All Of No Man's Land Is Ours,\" gave musical form to the military experience of the men and became popular recordings of the day.\nThe BSNM staff is proud to breathe new life into this part of African-American history with this monumental event, and it is a reminder that the work of Jim Europe and other military musicians will live forever. \n\n\nFor more information about the event, visit www.buffalosoldiermuseum.com.",

Two weeks after the outbreak of war Joyce was appointed editor and speaker for the German transmitters for Europe.\nTowards the end of the war, with the Red Army approaching Berlin, Joyce moved to Hamburg. After the war he was arrested near the Germany-Denmark border and was brought back to Britain. As the plane neared the coast Joyce exclaimed: “The white cliffs of Dover! God bless old England!” The start of the trial was delayed by wrangling over his nationality (he was born in New York and raised in Ireland) but he was charged with committing treason between 3 September 1939 and 2 July 1940, when his British passport ran out.\nJoyce was found guilty and hanged at Wandsworth Gaol in January 1946. He showed no emotion when confronted by news and scenes from the concentration camps, blaming the deaths on starvation and disease caused by Allied bombing of communication lines. He also scratched a swastika on the wall of his cell whilst awaiting sentence.
